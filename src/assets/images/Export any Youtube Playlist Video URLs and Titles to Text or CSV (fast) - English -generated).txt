first open your preferred web browser

and navigate to the YouTube playlist

page from which you want to export the

video titles and urls for example let's

use any random popular YouTube music

to paste the provided JavaScript code

Snippets in the console paste the first

code snippet labeled as code snippet1

this code will initiate an automated

scrolling action that will help us

gather all the necessary data from the

playlist page you can find the code

after pasting the code the page will

start scrolling automatically you need

to wait until the scrolling reaches the

bottom of the page this scrolling action

ensures that we collect all the video

titles and URLs from the YouTube

playlist once the scrolling stops you

can proceed to paste the second code

snippet labeled as code snippet2 this

code will extract the video titles and

URLs and display them in the console you

can find the code snippet 2 in the video

once you've pasted the second code

snippet the console will display the

video titles and URLs in the desired

further analysis or any other use if you

prefer to export the data as a CSV file
